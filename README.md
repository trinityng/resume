# Hello ✌🏻 Welcome 🥳  

## A little bit of myself 👩🏻

I am currently a senior at San Jose State University, majoring in Computer Science and specializing in full-stack web development. After carefully reviewing your job description, I believe that my academic training along with my work experiences makes me an ideal candidate for the job.
 
During my college education, not only have I excelled in my academics and technical skills through coursework and projects, but I also foster my soft skills through different working experiences as a Student Mentor, Student Assistant, and Medical Office Assistant. I believe in the power of self-learning; learning is infinite and there’s always room for growth. I have self-taught myself web development through online courses/tutorials and then applied that knowledge through building a web application for SJSU Hoplite and SJSU Machine Learning Club. These experiences have enhanced my knowledge and taught me how to learn new concepts quickly, handle multiples projects simultaneously, and team collaboration. In Summer 2019, I joined Roku, Inc. as a Cloud Engineering Intern for the Roku Voice team. At Roku, I was able to turn an idea into full-fledged application in only a few weeks. In Fall 2019, I joined Tesla's Factory Software team to develop Manufacturing Operating System for Model 3 and Model Y. I'm excited to bring my expertise and knowledge to solve challenges. I am passionate about software development, willing to learn and do what it takes to achieve your organizational goals.

I am confident that my skills and qualifications qualify me for consideration. I have also enclosed my resume, which further details my education and experiences. I look forward to meeting with you and discussing my qualifications in more detail. Please contact me via email at thn.trinity@gmail.com or (402) 807-9366.
Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Trinity Nguyen
